###Add-on description:

This Arma III Add-on expands the Zeus Real-Time Editor with new features.

First of all, I want to thank to [Anton Struyk](https://github.com/astruyk) for his [Ares Mod](https://github.com/astruyk/Ares) which expands the Zeus real-time editor with valuable features.
No one would argue that this mod changed completely the way we play Zeus and I can't think of playing without it.
Unfortunately, Ares hasn't been updated for ages.
My intention is to fix and further expand Ares with "Ares Mod - Achilles Expansion".

Notes:
- The add-on is a modified standalone version of Ares Mod and has to be run with CBA.
- **DO NOT RUN** this mod with Ares at the same time. All features from Ares are included anyway. 
- ACE3 is optional, but is requiered to unlock certain additional features.
- Moreover, only Zeus need to have the add-on installed as it was the case for Ares Mod.
