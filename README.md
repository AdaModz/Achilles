####Description
This an Arma 3 Expansion for Zeus.

First of all, I want to thank to [Anton Struyk for his Ares Mod](https://github.com/astruyk/Ares). No one would argue that this mod changed completely the way we play Zeus.
Based on this mod I used “execute code” module a lot for implementing new features. 
However, I realized that there are excellent Zeus players out there, who might not be familiar with scripting. 
Hence, I want to give them the opportunity to have access to new features as well. 
That is why I came up with the plan of this new expansion.

####Status
In development

####Aims
- The aim of the project is to implement more modules as well as increase cooperation with [ACE3](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3) and [CUP](http://cup-arma3.org/) addons.
- Reorganisation of existing Ares Modules
